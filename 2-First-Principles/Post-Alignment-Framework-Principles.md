# First Principles of the Post-Alignment Framework

*This document outlines the foundational tenets guiding the design and operation of the "Corralled Superintelligence" paradigm, moving beyond the traditional goal of value alignment.*

## Core Tenets

1.  **Primacy of Human Agency:**
    Human beings, through diverse and legitimate institutions, must retain ultimate decision-making authority and the capacity to direct, modify, or halt AGI development and deployment. AGI is a tool to augment, not replace, human judgment.

2.  **Inviolable Constraints, Not Internalized Values:**
    The focus shifts from instilling a perfect understanding of human values to creating robust, verifiable, and non-circumventable *constraints* on AGI behavior and capabilities. Safety is enforced externally through rules and boundaries, not relied upon internally.

3.  **Adaptive Governance:**
    The oversight mechanisms themselves must be designed to evolve, learn, and adapt as AGI capabilities grow and our understanding of the challenges deepens. This includes mechanisms for updating the core rule set ("AGI Constitution").

4.  **Transparency, Auditability, and Explainability (where possible):**
    Systems must be designed to allow for human scrutiny of AGI operations, decision-making processes, and potential impacts, to the greatest extent feasible without compromising safety. Opacity is a critical vulnerability.

5.  **Decentralization and Redundancy:**
    Avoid single points of failure or control in both AGI systems and their oversight mechanisms. Promote diversity in AGI architectures and oversight approaches to ensure resilience against unforeseen failures or attacks.

6.  **Focus on Harm Prevention, Not Value Perfection:**
    The immediate and primary goal is to prevent catastrophic outcomes, not to create a perfectly "good" or "wise" AGI. This involves robust containment, shutdown capabilities, and mitigation strategies, acknowledging that a perfect solution may be unattainable.

## Implications of the Principles

*   **Engineering Focus:** Effort is directed towards building enforceable boundaries and monitoring systems, not just optimizing goal functions.
*   **Governance Focus:** Requires the creation of new, agile institutions capable of technical oversight and ethical deliberation.
*   **Measurement of Success:** Success is measured by the absence of catastrophic harm and the preservation of human control, not by the AGI's adherence to a nebulous value set.

These principles form the philosophical bedrock for the subsequent technical and operational blueprints.
