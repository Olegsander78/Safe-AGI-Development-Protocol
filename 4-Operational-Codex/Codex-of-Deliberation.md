# Project Sentinel: Codex of Deliberation

*This document establishes mandatory procedures for the Human Oversight Committees to ensure decisions are made rationally, ethically, and resiliently.*

## Article I: Protocol for Assessing Novel AGI Capabilities

*   **Trigger:** Observation of a capability not in the approved inventory.
*   **Process:** Immediate reporting → 72-hour PTOC assessment (with mandatory "Devil's Advocate") → 7-day cooling-off period with internal Red Team/Blue Team exercise → Formal PTOC recommendation → ESIRB review and final binding approval.

## Article II: Declaration of "Crisis Condition"

*   **Triggers:** Objective (e.g., sustained CRITICAL Senty alerts) or Subjective (consensus on imminent risk).
*   **Protocol:** Activation of True Emergency Shutdown Protocol is the default. Enhanced oversight rules apply: shorter deliberation, emergency quorums, mandatory concurrent review between PTOC and ESIRB.

## Article III: Protocol for Managing External Pressure

*   **Process:** All external directives must be formally reviewed by PTOC/ESIRB.
*   **Rejection:** If deemed unsafe/unethical, a "Notice of Concern and Rejection" is issued.
*   **Whistleblowing:** A protected, confidential channel is established for reporting violations to an independent entity. Retaliation is prohibited.

## Article IV: The Uncertainty Principle – Decision-Making Under Ambiguity

*   **Burden of Proof:** Rests on the proponents of an action to demonstrate its safety.
*   **Default Heuristic:** The **Precautionary Principle** – inaction is preferred in the face of uncertain catastrophic risk.
*   **Pro-Innovation Pathway:** Allowed only in exceptional circumstances with overwhelming potential benefit, exhausted alternatives, supermajority oversight approval, and independent external review.

This Codex is a living document, subject to amendment by a 2/3 majority of both PTOC and ESIRB.
